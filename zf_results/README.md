# This is the file tracking tests run for Zero Forcing 

## ILT 
### K2 3 clone steps (16 vertices)
#### Initial set size: 7
- zero sets that fully force
- max amount of forces for any set is 3

#### Initial set size: 8
- 180 sets that fully forced (out of 16C8 = 12870 sets)
- all successful sets contained vertex 1 or 2 (or both) as part of the initially forced set
- vertices that were the forcers were all higher number vertices (13, 14, 15, 16)
